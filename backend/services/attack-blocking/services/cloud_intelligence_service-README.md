# Cloud Intelligence Service

## Overview

The Cloud Intelligence Service is a sophisticated component of the ScopeAPI attack-blocking service that provides cloud-based threat intelligence, adaptive security rules, and machine learning-enhanced threat detection capabilities. This service integrates with multiple cloud threat intelligence providers, manages adaptive security rules, and leverages ML models to enhance threat detection accuracy.

## Responsibilities

### Cloud Threat Intelligence
- **Multi-Provider Integration**: Connect with multiple cloud threat intelligence providers (VirusTotal, ThreatCrowd, AlienVault, etc.)
- **Intelligence Aggregation**: Collect and aggregate threat intelligence from various sources
- **Reputation Scoring**: Calculate comprehensive reputation scores for threat indicators
- **Intelligence Caching**: Cache threat intelligence data for improved performance
- **Real-time Queries**: Provide real-time threat intelligence lookups

### Adaptive Security Rules
- **Rule Management**: Create, update, and manage adaptive security rules
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate security events against adaptive rules
- **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Automatically update rules based on threat patterns
- **Rule Performance Tracking**: Monitor rule effectiveness and performance
- **Bulk Rule Operations**: Support batch operations for rule management

### Machine Learning Integration
- **ML Model Integration**: Connect with ML models for threat prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract and prepare features for ML models
- **Prediction Enhancement**: Use ML predictions to enhance threat intelligence
- **Model Performance Monitoring**: Track ML model performance and accuracy
- **Training Data Management**: Manage training data for model updates

### Threat Feed Management
- **Feed Integration**: Integrate with various threat intelligence feeds
- **Feed Parsing**: Parse different feed formats (JSON, CSV, STIX)
- **Feed Updates**: Automatically update threat feeds on schedule
- **Feed Validation**: Validate and sanitize feed data
- **Feed Statistics**: Track feed performance and statistics

### Event Processing
- **Security Event Processing**: Process incoming security events
- **Rule Matching**: Match events against adaptive rules
- **Action Execution**: Execute rule actions (block, alert, log)
- **Event Correlation**: Correlate events for pattern detection
- **Real-time Processing**: Process events in real-time

## Key Features

### Multi-Cloud Provider Support
- Support for multiple threat intelligence providers
- Provider-specific authentication and rate limiting
- Failover and redundancy across providers
- Provider health monitoring

### Intelligent Caching
- In-memory caching with configurable expiration
- Cache statistics and monitoring
- Automatic cache cleanup
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Adaptive Rule Engine
- Dynamic rule creation and updates
- Complex condition evaluation
- Multiple action types (block, alert, log, update)
- Rule performance analytics

### Machine Learning Enhancement
- Real-time ML predictions
- Feature extraction from security events
- Model performance tracking
- Automated model updates

### Comprehensive Reporting
- Threat intelligence analytics
- Rule performance reports
- Feed statistics reports
- ML model performance reports

## Service Dependencies

### Required Services
- **Repository Layer**: Data persistence for intelligence, rules, and feeds
- **Kafka Producer/Consumer**: Event streaming and messaging
- **Logger**: Structured logging and audit trails
- **ML Model Client**: Machine learning model interactions

### External Dependencies
- **Cloud Providers**: External threat intelligence APIs
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent data storage
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming platform

## Configuration

### Service Configuration
```go

    MaxCacheSize        int                        // Maximum cache entries
    ThreatFeedURLs      []string                   // Threat feed URLs
    CloudProviders      map[string]CloudProviderConfig // Provider configs
    MLModelEndpoint     string                     // ML model endpoint
    EnableAdaptiveRules bool                       // Enable adaptive rules
}
